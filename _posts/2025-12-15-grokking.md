### TLDR

Grokking, or delayed generalisation in neural networks, can
- help us understand when and how (potentially dangerous) capabilities can emerge in neural networks
- circumvent data limitations by showing that the right inductive biases can lead to strong networks
- be *partially* explained by current theories of lazy-to-feature learning, however, exceptions exist as shown below.

### What is grokking?

Grokking is what we
