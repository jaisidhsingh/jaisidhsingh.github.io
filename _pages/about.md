I am a master's student at the University of Tübingen studying machine learning and a fellow at [Zuse School ELIZA](https://eliza.school). I'm also a guest researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems Tübingen](https://is.mpg.de) advised by [Antonio Orvieto](http://orvi.altervista.org/).

I'm interested in a broad range of problems that include but are not limited to **architectural design** and **efficient training** of foundation models.
