I am a master's student at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de) studying machine learning and a fellow at [Zuse School ELIZA](https://eliza.school). I'm also a guest researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems Tübingen](https://is.mpg.de) advised by [Antonio Orvieto](http://orvi.altervista.org/). Previously, I was an intern at [Bosch Research India](https://www.bosch.com/research/about-bosch-research/research-locations/) during my undergrad at [IIT Jodhpur](https://iitj.ac.in). 

Coming from an engineering background, my approach to deep learning research seeks to harmonise applied and foundational research. My interests primarily align with, but are not limited to, **representation learning** and **efficient training** for foundation models.

If you're interested in collaborating or chatting about these topics, reach out to me via [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/jaisidhsingh.bsky.social) or [email](jaisidh.singh@student.uni-tuebingen.de). I like getting messages! For more information about my publications or work experience, you can check my [curriculum vitae](../assets/pdf/jaisidh_resume_web.pdf).
